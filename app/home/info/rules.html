    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
  </div>
  <h3>Game Procedure</h3>
  Fantasy Roller Derby is based on a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American)">Fantasy Football</a> style approach with drafting. In practice the procedure works as follows:

  <h4>Phase 1: League Formation</h4>
  When a league is created, it is initially in its <i>formation</i> phase: players can be added to (and removed from) the league.<p />

  <h4>Phase 2: Drafting</h4>
  Once everyone has joined, the commissioner (the creator of the league) advances the league onto the <i>drafting</i> phase. Now, everyone in the league drafts sequential players based on an S-curve (with a different starting point for the S-Curve for each tournament for fairness!). There is <b>no</b> 'money' mechanism: you can simply draft any player who hasn't already been drafted by someone else. <p />

  <h4>Phase 3: Scoring</h4>
  Once the draft has finished, or once that tournament has started (if the draft wasn't finished in time) the league moves into the <i>scoring</i> phase: at the end of each day of the tournament (...probably, depending on when Rinxter is updated!) all players' scores will be updated.<p/>

  <h3>Game Scoring</h3>
  Scoring is complex but:<br>
  - Blockers are rewarded for good point differences or good performances relative to team average (with a bonus for doing both!)<br>
  - Jammers are rewarded for leads gained, good point difference or good performance relative to team average (again with bonus!)<br>
  - All players are docked points for penalties.
  - Double Threats have a non-linear combination of blocker + jammer scores.
