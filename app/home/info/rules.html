  </div>
  <h3>Game Procedure</h3>
  Fantasy Roller Derby is based on a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American)">Fantasy Football</a> style approach with drafting. In practice the procedure works as follows:

  <div style="width:100%;margin-left:20px">
    <h4>Phase 1: Formation/selection</h4>
    <div style="width:100%;margin-left:20px">
      When a league is created, it is initially in its <i>formation</i> phase: users can be added to (and removed from) the league. During this time, all members may create a preferred selection order. In the drafting phase, drafts will be automatically taken from this. If you would rather do a classic, in-person draft, you are not obliged to fill this in.
      <p />
    </div>

  <h4>Phase 2: Drafting</h4>
  <div style="width:100%;margin-left:20px">
    Once everyone has joined, the commissioner (the creator of the league) advances the league onto the <i>drafting</i> phase. Here, users can continue to select players. The commissioner may also click "auto-draft" on a given tournament in order to commence the automatic draft process.

    If the next user to draft does not have a suitable entry in their selection preference list, they may pick at that time, or the commissioner may skip them. Note that if they are skipped, they will simply be put to the bottom of the order and will have the chance to draft later.<p />
  </div>

  <h4>Phase 3: Scoring</h4>
  <div style="width:100%;margin-left:20px">
    Once the draft has finished, or once that tournament has started (if the draft wasn't finished in time) the league moves into the <i>scoring</i> phase: at the end of each day of the tournament (...probably, depending on when statsbooks are available!) all players' scores will be updated.<p/>

  <h3>Game Scoring</h3>
  Scoring is as follows:<br>
  <div style="width:100%;margin-left:20px">
    a) Blockers are awarded 1 Fantasy Derby Point for every positive score-difference point they have while positioned as a blocker (absolute, or relative to team average, whichever is higher).<br>
    b) Jammers are awarded 1 Fantasy Derby Point for every positive score-difference point they have while positioned as a jammer (absolute, or relative to team average, whichever is higher).<br>
    c) Jammers are awarded 3 Fantasy Derby Points for every time they get lead.<br>
    d) All players start with 70 points but lose 10 for each penalty.<br>
    e) Double threats are a special position that get a combination of all the above!
