  </div>
  This app retains as little information as is practical. In fact, it only retains what Facebook send by default (used to login/identify you) and nothing additional. You may well have noticed that even your username is not validated in any way. <p />

  We do not collect any geographic information. We do not share any personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with anyone. We do not use or allow ad tracking of any kind. We take reasonable steps to protect what limited information we do have against unauthorised access or disclosure. <p />

  This policy was last updated on 9/7/2017.<p />
