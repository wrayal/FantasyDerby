    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
  </div>
  This app retains as little information as is possible. In fact, the only piece of data stored identifying you is your Facebook ID, which is the bare minimum to identify you between different logins. Despite the fact that by default FB offers public profile and so forth....we don't make any use of this. You may well have noticed that even your username is not validated in any way. <p />

  We do not collect any geographic information. Your "profile" (consisting of a solitary username) may be deleted at any time. We do not share any personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with anyone. Not least because we don't have it. We do not use or allow ad tracking of any kind. We take reasonable steps to protect what limited information we do have against unauthorised access or disclosure. <p />

  This policy was last updated on 6/9/2016.<p />
