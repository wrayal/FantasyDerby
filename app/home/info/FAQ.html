  <h4>Does the game work on mobile?</h4>
  ...just about. There are <b>SO MANY REASONS</b> this is not a suitable game to be played on a phone, so please use a computer if you can.<p />
  If you insist on using a phone/tablet, please note the following:<br>
  - If you are using an old browser, you're probably SOL.<br>
  - Touchscreen devices do not typically support drag and drop. Thankfully you can <i>still</i> draft by using press-and-hold.<br>
  - The stylesheets are written assuming you are not using an absurdly small screen. If something looks unusably weird, let me know - it may be unresolvable but I can at least take a look.<p />

  <h4>You decided to support mobile against your better judgement?</h4>
  What can I say? I like pain.

  <h4>X/Y/Z roster is out of date</h4>
  Unfortunately teams can choose to release rosters anywhere up until literally the day of their respective tournament. As a result, there's not a good programmatic way for me to keep on top of this, or indeed offer you all the available players. As a result, there was a functional cutoff roster date of...something. Probably 9th July or so. But note that this year, you can select players from teams that are NOT listed as playing in that tournament to allow for transfers. Sadly I cannot incorporate additional arbitrary players (not least because of non-uniqueness issues exacerbated by people having many different derby identities!)

  <h4>How does the game work?</h4>
  Go see <a href="" ui-sref="rules">here</a>.

  <h4>Are there any rules about names?</h4>
  At your discretion. Please nothing profane. Also please don't imitate someone.

  <h4>Do we have to draft for all tournaments?</h4>
  Nope! When you create the league you can select what tournaments you want to draft.

  <h4>Aren't Narwahls real?</h4>
  Have you ever seen one?

  <h4>Who wrote this?</h4>
  This was pretty much the sole work of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spectralaberwraytion/">Spectral</a>. It's all his fault.
  
  <h4>What does the game run on?</h4>
  The game runs on a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> and the Javascript & CSS equivalents of duct tape.
