  <h4>How does the game work?</h4>
  Go see <a href="" ui-sref="rules">here</a>.

  <h4>Are there any rules about names?</h4>
  At your discretion. Please nothing profane. Also please don't imitate someone.

  <h4>X/Y/Z roster is out of date</h4>
  Unfortunately teams can choose to release rosters anywhere up until literally the day of their respective tournament. As a result, there's not a good programmatic way for me to keep on top of this, or indeed offer you all the available players. As a result, there was a functional cutoff roster date of...something. A couple of weeks prior to Wichita. I'll look into rectifying this in future!

  <h4>Does the game work on mobile?</h4>
  It has not been tested at all for mobile. As a result, large chunks work (total luck I swear - nothing to do with good coding), some bits don't at all. It's definitely on the list for next time around.

  <h4>Do we have to draft for all tournaments?</h4>
  Nope! When you create the league you can select what tournaments you want to draft.

  <h4>Do we have to start before D2s?</h4>
  Nope! If you don't draft in time, that's fine, that tournament just earns zeroes.

  <h4>Aren't you going to get sued for this?</h4>
  I really hope not but who knows....

  <h4>Aren't Narwahls real?</h4>
  Have you ever seen one?

  <h4>Who wrote this?</h4>
  This was pretty much the sole work of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spectralaberwraytion/">Spectral</a>. It's all his fault.
  
  <h4>What does the game run on?</h4>
  The game runs on a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> and the Javascript & CSS equivalents of duct tape.
